<details>
<summary>User Stories test cases</summary>
<br>

#### **User Stories**
1. As a **Site User** I can **click the book appointment button on the landing page and/or navbar** so that **I can fill in a form to book an appointment with the trainer.**

    - Authorised user can view the booking form and submit a booking.
    - The form contains a submit button which will make a post request and save the booking if form is valid.
    - The form contains a cancel button which redirects straight to the Appoinmtents page in case the user changes their mind.


    ![desktop-form-buttons](static/readme/testing/add-booking-submit-buttons.jpg)
    ![mobile-form-buttons](static/readme/testing/mobile/submit-cancel-buttons-forms.jpg)

    - If some form fields are left blank or are invalid, the booking will not be saved.
    - The form handles custom error messages for:
        1. Duplicate bookings

        ![desktop-form-buttons](static/readme/testing/add_booking_duplicate-sm.jpg)

        2. Booking a date in tha past 
        3. Client age is below 18 or over 90

        ![desktop-form-buttons](static/readme/testing/add_booking_over_90.jpg)





    - Django handles other form validation isssues, like empty fields and prevents user from entering too many characters.

    ![desktop-form-buttons](static/readme/testing/django_empty_field.jpg)


    - If the form is valid then:

        1. The booking instance will be saved
        2. The user will be redirected to their appointments page where they can view all their bookings.
        3. A success message will inform the user that they successfully booked an appointment

    ![desktop-form-buttons](static/readme/testing/booking_success.jpg)

#
2. As a **Site User** I can **pick a date and time** so that **I can reserve a timeslot for my appointment.**

    - The form has a date and time field for users to pick their timeslot.


    ![desktop-datepicker](static/readme/testing/desktop-datepicker.png) 
    ![desktop-timepicker](static/readme/testing/desktop-timepicker.png)
    ![mobile-timepicker](static/readme/testing/mobile/timepicker.jpg)
    ![mobile-datepicker](static/readme/testing/mobile/mobile-datepicker.jpg)

    - The date field will throw an error
#

3. As a **Site User** I can **view my profile page** so that **I can see my upcoming appointments**

    - Once the user has submitted a booking form with no validation errors, it will be saved to the database.
    - A user's saved bookings are displayed in the user's My Appoinments page in their profile.

<details>
<summary>User Stories test cases</summary>
<br>

#### **User Stories**
1. As a **Site User** I can **use the change button** so that **I can edit an appointment on my profile to a different date/time**

    - Authorised user can view their appointments in their Appointments page.
    - Each appointment displays a change and delete button as seen in the previous test case pictures.
    - When a user clicks the change button they will be redirected to an edit form containing the fields related to the appoinment information.
    - The fields will be prepoulated with the appointment data.


    ![desktop-change button](static/readme/testing/edit_form.JPG)
   
    - Like the add booking form, the edit booking form prevents users from booking a duplicate date excluding the date of the form being edited in case the user wants to edit another field and keep that date.
    - If the booking is a duplicate the form will not save and will throw an error to the user explaining the problem with the duplicate date.

    ![desktop-change button](static/readme/testing/edit_form-duplicate.jpg)

    - The edit form will also prevent user from booking a date in the past.

    ![desktop-change button](static/readme/testing/edit-form-past-date.jpg)

    - The edit for contains 2 buttons, one to submit changes and one to "Don't change".

    ![desktop-change button](static/readme/testing/edit_form_buttons.JPG)

    - If the user clicks don't change, they will be redirected back to their appoiments page without saving any changes.
    - If the user clicks Submit changes and there are no field errors in the form then:
        1. The changes will be saved to the booking instance.
        2. The user will be directed to the appointments page withthe update appoinment data.
        3. A success message will be displayed to the user.

## Code Validation

<details>
<summary>ðŸ‘‡</summary>

1. ### HTML Validation

HTML validation was done using 
[W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). In order to validate the HTML without getting errors due to the Django template tags, the following steps were followed:

1. Navigate to the deployed site url using the google chrome browser.
2. Navigate to the page of the site you want to validate.
3. Right click anywhere on said page and select "View page source".
4. Copy the source code and open the validator.
5. Select Validate by direct input and paste the code into the validator field and click "Check"

Below are the issues encountered during vinitial alidation: 

**Home Page**

* A warning to add a language attribute to the html tag
* Several Info messages to remove trailing / from self-closing elements like <img> and <link>. I discovered that these were getting added automatically whenever I used the prettier command to tidy up the template code. 
    ![home-page](static/readme/testing/code-validation/hmtl-val-homepage.JPG)

    ![all-messages](static/readme/testing/code-validation/trailing-slash-errors.JPG)

**Sign in Page**

* No errors

**Sign up Page**

* No errors

**Sign out Page**

* No errors

**Add booking form page**

* An attribute error for using "placeholder" with date input. The source of this error was in the forms.py date widget. I simply removed the placeholder attribute.
* The end tag error and unlcosed element were related. The both errors were dealt with upon locating the unclosed div and closing it.

    ![booking-page](static/readme/testing/code-validation/booking_form_validator_errors.JPG)

**Update booking form page**

* Unsurprisingly the same unclosed div error results occured on this page as the one in the booking form page. Since I create the update form template by copy, pasting and making adjustments to the booking form, this was expected and fixed in the same manner.


    ![booking-page](static/readme/testing/code-validation/update_booking_error.JPG)


**User Profile page**

* No errors


**Cancel appoinment confirmation page**

* An empty attribute value error for the form attribute action="".

    ![booking-page](static/readme/testing/code-validation/cancel_confirmation_error.JPG)

**404 page**

* No errors



2. CSS
* CSS Validation was done using [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

* No bugs were found in the CSS at the final tetsing stage as I had been testing throughout development and CSS bugs were common and obvious in the gitpod browser so were quickly identified and fixed.

4. Python 

[PEP8 Online Validator](http://pep8online.com/)
